This thesis analyzes the current status and wiring of a master touchscreen device that is designed 
to control exterior blinds in a smart home. It deals with the theoretical and practical parts of user 
interface design, visualization and programming of the microcontroller. It includes general 
information and schematic representations required for the design and programming of the 
display and master device. The aim of the thesis is to complete the graphical user interface display 
and program the master device with a microcontroller.

Attachments for the MASTER device:
- Master_ATmega324PB.zip => Project programmed in Microchip Studio for the master device with ATmega324PB chip (C language).
- Master_ATmega324PB_backup.zip => Project backed up from Microchip Studio using the "Export Template" function.

Attachments for the NEXTION display Editor:
- Nextion_HMI.zip => Project programmed using the Nextion Editor.
- TFT_output.zip => Output HMI file from the Nextion Editor (MainScreen.tft), for uploading to the display via microSD card.
